# spaceInvadersClone

This game was an assignment for a college course.
The goal is to build a 2d or 3d game using monogame (C#) 
The Professor provided the barebones of the game scenes and 
the collison library to use.

The indended purpose it to apply object-oriented principles
using the C# language.

There are a few known bugs 
I hope to get around to patching in the coming months.
